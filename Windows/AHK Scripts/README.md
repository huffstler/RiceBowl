    Removes Title Text from windows titlebars (i think). Never really used it

    This is a nice little script that changes the power mode of your laptop. THIS DOES NOT WORK OUT OF THE BOX. You must find out the guid for each of the modes you intend to use. To find these out, in powershell or cmd run the command: `powercfg.exe /L`

    For whatever mode you want to turn on, use that key in place of where I have mine.

# For neatness and future sanity, set up modes of editing, where in a certain mode, certain keys will do certain things
# ie, in window mode, up, left, right, and down keys move the focus to windows in those directions
# in movement mode, left, up, down, right move the current window in that direction
# in screen mode, left and right decrease and increase volume, while up and down increase and decrease screen brightness.
# other modes based upon future needs.
